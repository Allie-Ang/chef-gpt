# chef-gpt
## Description
With the advent of artificial intelligences available to internet-wide audiences, questions have begun to abound around potential use-values for every day users. Our team developed this project with the idea that mediated interactions with artificial intelligences might prove an effective means of harnessing the technology's power for a casual user. While model fine-tuning represents a far more complex means of elevating the potential output of an artificial intelligence, our application demonstrates that mediated interactions certainly prove a regular, predictible, and user-friendly means of extracting use-values from an interaction with artificial intelligence.

## Installation
In order to simulate the development environment on your machine, users must first download NodeJS. A step by step guide to download NodeJS onto your machine may be found [here.](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/nodejs/how-to-install-nodejs) Once the installation is complete, navigate to the project's [public repository](https://github.com/csanchezwagenbach/chef-gpt) and download all the files onto your machine. Before going further, you'll need your own API Key, available for free when you make an account [here.](https://openai.com/api/) Using command-line interface from your terminal, navigate to the downloaded repository, run the command "npm i", followed by "node server.js" to turn on the Express.js server. PLEASE NOTE that environmental variables MUST be configured in a .env folder to access all functionality on your local machine!

## Usage
Utilizing our application, users interact with OpenAI's GPT-3 engine by way of a questionnaire gathering data around ingredients, dietary restrictions, and time constraints around the ability to prepare food. Users may save sugestions they want to later reference and can easily receive new suggestions. Please reference the video below for a sample demonstration of the application's functionality.
